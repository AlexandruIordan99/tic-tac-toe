Tic Tac Toe:

Implement Game Object

Game must have:

Gameboard with 3 columns and 3 rows

2 players

Each player must have either X or 0

The game is turn based

3 of the same symbols vertically, diagonally or horizontally result in a win for the respective player

Prevent players from inserting their symbol on an already populated container

Option store symbols in arrays: 9 total symbols at most

3 rows + 3 columns + 2 diagonal lines = 8 mini arrays

on round end, if a mini array is full, check if the symbol is the same

Optimisation: prevent checking an array if it has already been checked

If all squares have been drawn on and nobody has won, end the game in a tie
